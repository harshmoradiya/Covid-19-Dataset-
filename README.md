Queries on SQL

Project Overview
This project utilizes SQL to analyze COVID-19 data, with queries ranging from beginner to advanced levels. The focus is on extracting and interpreting data related to case counts, deaths, and vaccination rates across different countries and continents, with a particular emphasis on India. The analysis aims to provide valuable insights that can assist doctors and health organizations in making informed decisions.

Business Problem
The COVID-19 pandemic requires comprehensive data analysis to understand its spread, impact, and effectiveness of interventions. This project addresses several key questions, including:

The likelihood of dying from COVID-19 in India based on total cases and deaths.
The total percentage of deaths relative to the entire population in India.
Identification of the country with the highest death percentage.
The total percentage of positive COVID-19 cases in India and globally.
Continent-wise positive cases and deaths.
Daily new cases versus hospitalization and ICU patients in India.
The proportion of the population over 65 years old by country.
The total number of fully vaccinated people by country.

Conclusion
The analysis of COVID-19 data through SQL queries provides critical insights that can help doctors and health organizations make data-driven decisions. By understanding the trends in case counts, mortality rates, and vaccination progress, public health strategies can be better tailored to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. These insights are vital for planning healthcare resources, implementing preventive measures, and ultimately saving lives.
